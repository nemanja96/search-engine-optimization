          <h2>1. Title</h2>
          <p>
            The title element defines the title of the document. The title must
            be text - only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the
            page's tab.

          <h2>2. Description</h2>
          <p>
            The meta description is an HTML attribute that provides a brief
            summary of a web page. Search engines such as Google often display
            the meta description in search results, which can influence click -
            through rates.

          <h2>3. Charset</h2>
          <p>
            The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML
            document. The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use
            the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters
            and symbols in the world.

        <div class="steps">
          <h2>4. Keywords</h2>
          <p>
            Meta keywords are a specific type of meta tag that appear in the
            HTML code of a Web page and help tell search engines what the topic
            of the page is.

          <h2>5. Viewport</h2>
          <p>
            Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for
            computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static
            design and a fixed size. Then, when we started surfing the internet
            using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large
            to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled
            down the entire web page to fit the screen.
          </p>
          <code
            ><span

          <h2>7. Compress Images</h2>
          <p>
            Image compression is minimizing the size in bytes of a graphics file without degrading the quality of the image to an unacceptable level. The reduction in file size allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space. It also reduces the time required for images to be sent over the Internet or downloaded from Web pages.

        <div class="steps">
          <h2>8. Optimized Image with an Alt tag</h2>
          <p>
            Adding images to your articles encourages people to read them, and well-chosen images can also back up your message and get you a good ranking in image search results. But you should always remember to give your images good alt attributes: alt text strengthens the message of your articles with search engine spiders and improves the accessibility of your website.

          <h2>9. URL</h2>
          <p>
            A site's URL structure should be as simple as possible. Consider organizing your content so that URLs are constructed logically and in a manner that is most intelligible to humans (when possible, readable words rather than long ID numbers).

          <h2>10. Minify and Compress - HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            There are two useful techniques that can be used to improve the performance of your web page: Minification and Data compression. Incorporating both of these techniques reduces payload sizes and in turn improves page load times. Minification is the process of removing whitespace and any code that is not necessary to create a smaller but perfectly valid code file. Compression is the process of modifying data using a compression algorithm.
